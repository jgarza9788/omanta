// Compression and extraction over libarchive, as plain blocking functions the
// operation worker calls on its thread. libarchive rather than gnome-autoar:

// progress, cancellation and the staging strategy — and no GObject async to
// bridge. Local paths only; archives on gvfs mounts are out of scope.

// extension: .zip, .tar.xz, .7z. A non-empty password produces an encrypted
// zip (zipcrypt, the same traditional encryption Nautilus/autoar writes, so
// Windows Explorer can open it); it is ignored for the other formats.

// a hidden staging directory first, so a failed extraction leaves nothing
// behind; entry paths are sanitized, so a hostile archive cannot write
// outside the destination. `produced` receives the final top-level path.
// `needsPassphrase` (optional) is set when the failure was a missing or wrong
// password — the caller can ask for one and retry instead of showing an error.
// `created` optionally receives the per-entry journal for a safe Undo.
